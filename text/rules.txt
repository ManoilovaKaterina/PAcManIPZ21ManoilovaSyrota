You play as a yellow ball-shaped creature - Pac-Man.
The main goal of the game is to eat all the white
dots on the level. At the same time, four ghosts
will constantly interfere with him - Inky, Pinky,
Blinky and Clyde. When they touch Pac-Man, he
will lose a life (there are 3 in total).
Also, Pac-Man can eat a large dot, which makes
the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them,
and get points for them. However, each ghost
eaten will reappear at the spawn point.
